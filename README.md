Here are my repositories:

# [First Week](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/Kaugar/tree/master/week-01)
It is about expressions and control flow in JAVA and basic directory management. And of course some lame HTML pages just for practice.

# [Second Week](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/Kaugar/tree/master/week-02)
It is about array and functions, data structures and some drawing practice! So much fun here!

# [Third Week](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/Kaugar/tree/master/week-03)
We practice file and exception handling, get some Objective Oriented knowledge and draw some real arts in a recursive way.
